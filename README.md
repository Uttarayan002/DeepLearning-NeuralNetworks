## Neural Network Architectures
### Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
ANNs are the foundation of deep learning. They consist of layers of interconnected neurons and are used for tasks like regression and classification.

- Explanation : [ANN Explanation](https://github.com/Uttarayan002/DeepLearning-NeuralNetworks/blob/main/Artificial%20Neural%20Network/Readme.md)

- Code : [All ANN modular codes]()

### Dense Neural Networks (DNNs)
DNNs are fully connected networks where each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. They are ideal for tabular data.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
RNNs are designed for sequential data and can capture temporal dependencies. Variants like LSTM and GRU are commonly used.
